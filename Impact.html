  <h1>How is AI the future?</h1>
</div>
<font color="pink" style="cooperblack" size=5><center><pre>WHY IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IMPORTANT?</center></font>
<font color="grey" style="Aerial"></pre>Artificial intelligence is drastically important to our future because AI forms the very foundation of computer learning. Through AI, computers have the ability to harness massive amounts of data and use their learned intelligence to make optimal decisions and discoveries in fractions of the time that it would take humans. Artificial intelligence is becoming responsible for everything from medical breakthroughs in cancer research to cutting-edge climate change research.</font>
<font color="white" size=5><br><br><br>1) Transportation: Although it could take a decade or more to perfect them, autonomous cars will one day ferry us from place to place.
<br><br>2) Manufacturing: AI powered robots work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.
<br><br>3) Healthcare: In the comparatively AI-nascent field of healthcare, diseases are more quickly and accurately diagnosed, drug discovery is sped up and streamlined, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients and big data analysis helps to create a more personalized patient experience.
<br><br>4) Education: Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI, early-stage virtual tutors assist human instructors and facial analysis gauges the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored and better tailor the experience to their individual needs.
<br><br>5) Media: Journalism is harnessing AI, too, and will continue to benefit from it. Bloomberg uses Cyborg technology to help make quick sense of complex financial reports. The Associated Press employs the natural language abilities of Automated Insights to produce 3,700 earning reports stories per year — nearly four times more than in the recent past.
<br><br>6) Customer Service: Last but hardly least, Google is working on an AI assistant that can place human-like calls to make appointments at, say, your neighborhood hair salon. In addition to words, the system understands context and nuance.
